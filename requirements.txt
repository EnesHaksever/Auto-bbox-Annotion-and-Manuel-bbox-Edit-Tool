# NOTE: torch/torchvision are **not** listed above because their
# installation differs for CPU vs GPU.  After creating the venv use one
# of the commands below depending on your setup:
#
#   CPU-only (fallback)    : pip install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#   GPU (CUDA 12.1)        : pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# Adjust the index-url to cu118 or other if you need a different CUDA
# toolkit version.  The installer will pick a release that matches your
# Python / platform automatically.
